## 🧠 Canvas-based Whiteboard (React Migration in Progress)

This is a real-time whiteboard application originally built with Vue.js, now being rewritten in **React** and **TypeScript** to explore scalable frontend architecture.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Interactive Canvas**: Drawing, dragging, and real-time object manipulation using HTML5 Canvas
- **Event Handling**: Custom zoom/pan/selection logic with precise mouse and keyboard events
- **Performance Focused**: Efficient re-rendering strategies for large canvas states
- **State Management**: Migrating from Vue + Pinia to **React + Recoil** (or Zustand)
- **Component Design**: Modular React component structure for maintainability and scalability

### 🚀 Why This Project Matters
As a frontend engineer with a background in Vue-based authoring tools, I’m now applying that expertise in a React environment. This project demonstrates:
- Strong understanding of **complex UI interactions**
- Ability to **rebuild and refactor** production-level features across frameworks
- Ongoing exploration of **modern frontend tools** like TypeScript, Recoil, and Vite
